# cypheRS

Pure Rust implementation of all cryptographic algorithms (for fun and learning!).

## Disclaimer

Never deploy your own crypto implementations in production, i.e. you should only implement crypto algorithms for fun and learning.
All implementations of the various cryptographic algorithms found in this repository are **NOT audited** and, thus, are not secure.
Please do not deploy in production.
